# About This Project
## Description
I am excited to introduce my phase 4 web application, Recipe Ranger! Recipe Ranger is a Ruby on Rails web application that allows users to browse and filter through a comprehensive list of recipes, create and delete their own recipe reviews, and update their reviews. The application allows users to create an account, log in, and search for recipes based on meal course, sort by name (A-Z or Z-A), and sort by time to complete (up or down). Users can also search for recipes by title and view recipe details, including instructions, notes, meal course, and cooking time.

Recipe Ranger showcases a comprehensive list of all the recipes in the system, and provides a button that allows users to create a new recipe review. With Recipe Ranger, users can easily keep track of their favorite recipes and share their thoughts with others. The application also allows users to edit or delete reviews they have previously submitted.
